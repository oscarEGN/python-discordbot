# python-discordbot

A basic Discord Bot coded in python, that can play song, translate docs etc...

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/oscaregn/python-discordbot
cd python-discordbot
python3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Things to modify before launching it...

  -You need to put your discord dev token from your bot app in the variable called TOKEN
  -If you want to add the play music fonctionality you must add the musics yourself, following the template
  -The bot script need to be working 24/24 7/7 to be considered as a good bot so if you can let your computer run 24/24 7/7 you can use repl.it with flask and uptime robot. If you can let your computer do the job, then simply delete the keep_alive() def.
  
## Launch and have fun
### Launch it Localy:

 ```
 python3 main.py
 ```
 
 ### Launch it for free on the cloud ( using replit flask and uptime robot )
 
 You just need to go on this [Replit](https://replit.com/@oscarEGN/discordbot#main.py)
 Yeah he is in French and he has urss anthem in songs but that was just for testings.
 So you need to clone it, create a new secret variable called "token" and put it on your code, then you create an account on uptime robot to stope the 5min limit that are on Flasks server in Repl.it, you create a new bot and put it the flask url adress.
